## react-yoga-dom

A React renderer for the DOM / web using Yoga for layout. Useful for rendering React Native views to the web. Not for production use.

In other words, it's a replacement for `ReactDOM` that adds DOM element styles for layout properties derived from Yoga using its flexbox model.

Yoga is a layout engine from Facebook that was popularized by React Native. It's based on flexbox from CSS but not entirely the same.

**This is still in the experimental stage, more documentation to follow as it becomes more stable**

[See the playground](https://swj.io/react-yoga-dom) for the current state in action.
